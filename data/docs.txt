Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that improves question
answering systems by combining information retrieval with natural language
generation. Instead of relying only on a language model’s internal knowledge,
RAG systems retrieve relevant documents from an external knowledge source and
use them to generate answers.

A RAG evaluation system is designed to measure how effectively a
retrieval-augmented model performs. The evaluation focuses on whether the
retrieved documents are relevant to the query and whether the generated answer
is grounded in the retrieved content.

One important metric used in RAG evaluation is faithfulness. Faithfulness
measures how well the generated answer is supported by the retrieved documents.
A low faithfulness score may indicate hallucination, where the model produces
information that is not present in the source documents.

Another key metric is stability. Stability measures how consistent the model’s
answers are when the same query is asked multiple times. Low stability can
indicate uncertainty or sensitivity to randomness in generation.

RAG evaluation systems are commonly used in applications such as customer
support bots, internal document search, legal document analysis, and knowledge
assistants. Evaluating these systems helps identify weaknesses in retrieval,
generation, or document chunking strategies.

By analyzing evaluation metrics, developers can improve RAG systems by adjusting
chunk sizes, embedding models, retrieval strategies, or reranking mechanisms.
This process helps create more reliable, accurate, and trustworthy
question-answering systems.
